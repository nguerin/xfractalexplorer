consent.

Here are a few things to do. I may implement some of them
quickly, and may not...
If you want to do one of these improvements, or others, just
do them and contact me !!


BUGS TO CORRECT
===============

- log palette with some fractal types
- problems with the menu creation on some platforms
- Command window refreshing



ENHANCEMENTS
============

- Anti-aliasing: for each pixel, calculate 4 or 9 or 16 points and average

   -----
- Several logpalettes. Need slower increase.
- Automatic iteration ?
- HSV color space ?


Interface
---------
- Open a special window when a fractal type is selected,
  where we can change the parameters and view the fractal
  equation.
- Allow the program to make posters composed of several
  Postscript files.
- Save postscript in different page formats 
  (A4 only available now).
- Enter new fractal types.
- window size scalable with mouse.
- Improve the status window.
- Ressource management.


Computation
-----------
- inside color
- periodicity checking
- continuous potential method
- color distance estimator method
- color decomposition method



- Couleurs: se reserver N&B ?
- faire un package pour la distribution
- Pb des ratios. ecran 1280/1024 ou autre.
- fichier contenant les valeurs initiales par defaut
- mettre a jour la doc
