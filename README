INTRODUCTION
============

	XFractal_explorer is, as you may have already understood, a program
which allows you to compute and explore fractals. The types of fractals 
available are:
- Mandelbrot
- Julia
- Mandel-n
- Julia-n
- Newton
- Lambda & MandelLambda
- Mark's Mandel & Julia
- Barnsley 1,2,3 Mandel & Julia
- MandelCosine & JuliaCosine
- MandelSine & JuliaSine
- Noel 1 & 2
- Phoenix
- Spider
	
	XFractal_Explorer can speak English as well as French.

	The program runs under X Window and uses Motif. Furthermore, it needs
a 8 plane display (256 colors).
	You will find more information in the xfe.doc files. xfe.doc.eng is in
English whereas xfe.doc.fra is in French.



COMPILATION
===========

You will have to use the Makefile: 
Go in the 'src' directory.
You will probably have to modify the Makefile (change the
X11 and Motif paths at least).
You may also want to modify some constants (image size...) in the
fractal_type.h file.
Then type 'make' and wait.

The program has been tested on hpux systems (hp 9000),apollo and 
IBM RS 6000.

Enjoy it !!!
